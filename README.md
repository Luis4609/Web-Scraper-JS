# ScraperJs
## Requirements:
Have installed NodeJs in your machine, in this case we check that the application works with the version 14.15.3 and also with the LTS version of NodeJs 16.13.2.

## To start
Create a folder for your project, here you can take the two options that I describe to you later on:

### From zero:
```bash
npm init
npm install axio cheerio
```

### Cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luis4609/Web-Scraper-JS.git
npm install 
```

### Run NodeJs:
```bash
node scraper.js
```
